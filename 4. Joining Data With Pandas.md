# Inner Join

## Inner join - will only returns rows having matching values on both tables
>**Merge syntax**
```python
ward_census = wards.merge(census, on='ward') #Two dataframes are merged on ward column
```

>**Suffixes syntax**
```python
ward_census = wards.merge(census, on='ward', suffixes=('_ward','_cen')) 
#Suffixes (overlapping columns) can be controlled instead of default _x and _y
```

>**Example - Your first inner join**
>> You have been tasked with figuring out what the most popular types of fuel used in Chicago taxis are. To complete the analysis, you need to merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables together on the vid column. You can then use the merged table along with the .value_counts() method to find the most common fuel_type.

```python
# Merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables
taxi_own_veh = taxi_owners.merge(taxi_veh, on="vid")

# Print the column names of the taxi_own_veh
print(taxi_own_veh.columns)

>> Output
Index(['rid', 'vid', 'owner_x', 'address', 'zip', 'make', 'model', 'year', 'fuel_type', 'owner_y'], dtype='object')

# Merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables setting a suffix
taxi_own_veh = taxi_owners.merge(taxi_veh, on='vid', suffixes = ('_own','_veh'))

# Print the column names of taxi_own_veh
print(taxi_own_veh.columns)

>> Output
Index(['rid', 'vid', 'owner_own', 'address', 'zip', 'make', 'model', 'year', 'fuel_type', 'owner_veh'], dtype='object')

# Print the value_counts to find the most popular fuel_type
print(taxi_own_veh['fuel_type'].value_counts()) # It counts the distinct values and their counts

>> Output

HYBRID                    2792
GASOLINE                   611
FLEX FUEL                   89
COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS      27
Name: fuel_type, dtype: int64
```

>**Example -Inner joins and number of rows returned**
>> All of the merges you have studied to this point are called inner joins. It is necessary to understand that inner joins only return the rows with matching values in both tables. You will explore this further by reviewing the merge between the wards and census tables, then comparing it to merges of copies of these tables that are slightly altered, named wards_altered, and census_altered. The first row of the wards column has been changed in the altered tables. You will examine how this affects the merge between them. The tables have been loaded for you.

```python
# Merge the wards and census tables on the ward column
wards_census = wards.merge(census, on="ward")

# Print the shape of wards_census
print('wards_census table shape:', wards_census.shape)

>> Output
wards_census table shape: (50, 9)

# Print the first few rows of the wards_altered table to view the change 
print(wards_altered[['ward']].head())

# Merge the wards_altered and census tables on the ward column
wards_altered_census = wards_altered.merge(census, on="ward")

# Print the shape of wards_altered_census
print('wards_altered_census table shape:', wards_altered_census.shape)

>> Output
  ward
0   61
1    2
2    3
3    4
4    5
wards_altered_census table shape: (49, 9)

# Print the first few rows of the census_altered table to view the change 
print(census_altered[['ward']].head())

# Merge the wards and census_altered tables on the ward column
wards_census_altered = wards.merge(census_altered, on="ward")

# Print the shape of wards_census_altered
print('wards_census_altered table shape:', wards_census_altered.shape)

>> Output
   ward
0  None
1     2
2     3
3     4
4     5
wards_census_altered table shape: (49, 9)
```

## One-to-many relationships

>**One-to-one** = Every row in the left table is related to one and only one row in the right table
>**One-to-many** = Every row in the left table is related to one or more one rows in the right table
>**Example - One-to-many merge**
>> A business may have one or multiple owners. In this exercise, you will continue to gain experience with one-to-many merges by merging a table of business owners, called biz_owners, to the licenses table. Recall from the video lesson, with a one-to-many relationship, a row in the left table may be repeated if it is related to multiple rows in the right table. In this lesson, you will explore this further by finding out what is the most common business owner title. (i.e., secretary, CEO, or vice president)

```python
# Merge the licenses and biz_owners table on account
licenses_owners = licenses.merge(biz_owners, on="account")

# Group the results by title then count the number of accounts
counted_df = licenses_owners.groupby("title").agg({'account':'count'}) #This is the way to calculate multiple stats

# Sort the counted_df in desending order
sorted_df = counted_df.sort_values("account", ascending=False)

# Use .head() method to print the first few rows of sorted_df
print(sorted_df.head())

>> Output
                 account
title                   
PRESIDENT           6259
SECRETARY           5205
SOLE PROPRIETOR     1658
OTHER               1200
VICE PRESIDENT       970
```
## Merging Multiple DataFrames

>**Single Merge**
```python
grants.merge(licenses, on=['address', 'zip'])
```
>**Multiple Merge**
```python
grants_license_ward = grants.merge(licenses, on=['address', 'zip']) \ #Python will read this one line of code
                      .merge(wards, on='ward', suffixes==('_bus','_ward')
grants_license_ward.head()
```
>**Results**
```python
import matplot.pyplot as plt
grants_license_ward.groupby('ward')['grant'].agg('sum').plot(kind='bar', y='grant')
plt.show()
```

```
>**Example - Total riders in a month**
>> Your goal is to find the total number of rides provided to passengers passing through the Wilson station (station_name == 'Wilson') when riding Chicago's public transportation system on weekdays (day_type == 'Weekday') in July (month == 7). Luckily, Chicago provides this detailed data, but it is in three different tables. You will work on merging these tables together to answer the question. This data is different from the business related data you have seen so far, but all the information you need to answer the question is provided.

>> The cal, ridership, and stations DataFrames have been loaded for you. The relationship between the tables can be seen in the diagram below.

![alt text](https://github.com/heramb-joshi/DataCampDataAnalyst/blob/main/Images/Chapter%204/Diagram_4.4.1.png)
```python
# Merge the ridership and cal tables
ridership_cal = ridership.merge(cal, on=['year','month','day'])

# Merge the ridership, cal, and stations tables
ridership_cal_stations = ridership.merge(cal, on=['year','month','day']) \
            				.merge(stations, on="station_id")
                    
# Merge the ridership, cal, and stations tables
ridership_cal_stations = ridership.merge(cal, on=['year','month','day']) \
							.merge(stations, on='station_id')

# Create a filter to filter ridership_cal_stations
filter_criteria = ((ridership_cal_stations['month'] == 7) 
                   & (ridership_cal_stations['day_type'] == "Weekday") 
                   & (ridership_cal_stations['station_name'] == "Wilson"))

# Use .loc and the filter to select for rides
print(ridership_cal_stations.loc[filter_criteria, 'rides'].sum())

>> Output
140005
```
>**Example - 3 Three table merge**
>> To solidify the concept of a three DataFrame merge, practice another exercise. A reasonable extension of our review of Chicago business data would include looking at demographics information about the neighborhoods where the businesses are. A table with the median income by zip code has been provided to you. You will merge the licenses and wards tables with this new income-by-zip-code table called zip_demo.

```python
# Merge licenses and zip_demo, on zip; and merge the wards on ward
licenses_zip_ward = licenses.merge(zip_demo, on="zip") \
							.merge(wards, on="ward")
            			

# Print the results by alderman and show median income
print(licenses_zip_ward.groupby("alderman").agg({'income':'median'}))


>> Output

>**One-to-many merge with multiple tables**
>> In this exercise, assume that you are looking to start a business in the city of Chicago. Your perfect idea is to start a company that uses goats to mow the lawn for other businesses. However, you have to choose a location in the city to put your goat farm. You need a location with a great deal of space and relatively few businesses and people around to avoid complaints about the smell. You will need to merge three tables to help you choose your location. The land_use table has info on the percentage of vacant land by city ward. The census table has population by ward, and the licenses table lists businesses by ward.
```python
# Merge land_use and census and merge result with licenses including suffixes
land_cen_lic = land_use.merge(census, on="ward") \
                       .merge(licenses, on="ward", suffixes=("_cen","_lic"))
                       
# Group by ward, pop_2010, and vacant, then count the # of accounts
pop_vac_lic = land_cen_lic.groupby(["ward","pop_2010","vacant"], 
                                   as_index=False).agg({'account':'count'}) 
                                   #As_index = False will make sure the result is available in the dataset format
                                   
# Sort pop_vac_lic and print the results
sorted_pop_vac_lic = pop_vac_lic.sort_values(["vacant","account","pop_2010"], 
                                             ascending=[False, True, True])

# Print the top few rows of sorted_pop_vac_lic
print(sorted_pop_vac_lic.head())

>> Output
   ward  pop_2010  vacant  account

# Left Join
## Left Join
> Returns All rows from left table and only matching key columns from the right tables
> Merge with left join
```python
movie_taglines = movies.merge(taglines, on="id", how="left") 
#how defines how the join is perfromed. Default value is inner

#Whenever ther is no matching, missing data is reflected as NaN
```
>**Example - Left Join**
```python
# Merge movies and financials with a left join
movies_financials = movies.merge(financials, on="id", how="left")

# Count the number of rows in the budget column that are missing
number_of_missing_fin = movies_financials['budget'].isna().sum()

# Print the number of movies missing financials
print(number_of_missing_fin)

>> Output
1574
```
>**Example2 - Enriching a dataset**
>> Setting how='left' with the .merge()method is a useful technique for enriching or enhancing a dataset with additional information from a different table. In this exercise, you will start off with a sample of movie data from the movie series Toy Story. Your goal is to enrich this data by adding the marketing tag line for each movie. You will compare the results of a left join versus an inner join.
```python
# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with a left join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on="id", how="left")

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)

>> Output
      id        title  popularity release_date                   tagline
0  10193  Toy Story 3      59.995   2010-06-16  No toy gets left behind.

## Other Joins
> Right Join
>> Returns all of the rows from the right table and only those rows from the left table having matching key column values

>**Merge with right join - Syntax**
```python
tv_movies = movies.merge(tv_genre, how="right", left_on="id", right_on="movie_id") 
#left_on and right_on attributes are used to specify key columns from left and right tables respectively

```

> Outer Join
>> Returns all of the records from both tables regardless if there is a match between both the tables

>**Merge with outer join**
```python
family_comedy = family.merge(comedy, on="movie_id", how="outer", suffixes=("_fam", "_com"))
```

>**Example - Right join to find unique movies**
>> Most of the recent big-budget science fiction movies can also be classified as action movies. You are given a table of science fiction movies called scifi_movies and another table of action movies called action_movies. Your goal is to find which movies are considered only science fiction movies. Once you have this table, you can merge the movies table in to see the movie names. Since this exercise is related to science fiction movies, use a right join as your superhero power to solve this problem.
```python
# Merge action_movies to scifi_movies with right join
action_scifi = action_movies.merge(scifi_movies, on='movie_id', how='right',
                                   suffixes=("_act", "_sci"))

# Print the first few rows of action_scifi to see the structure
print(action_scifi.head())

>>Output

# From action_scifi, select only the rows where the genre_act column is null
scifi_only = action_scifi[action_scifi["genre_act"].isna()]

# Merge the movies and scifi_only tables with an inner join
movies_and_scifi_only = movies.merge(scifi_only, left_on = "id", right_on="movie_id")

# Print the first few rows and shape of movies_and_scifi_only
print(movies_and_scifi_only.head())
print(movies_and_scifi_only.shape)

>**Example - Popular genres with right join**
>> What are the genres of the most popular movies? To answer this question, you need to merge data from the movies and movie_to_genres tables. In a table called pop_movies, the top 10 most popular movies in the movies table have been selected. To ensure that you are analyzing all of the popular movies, merge it with the movie_to_genres table using a right join. To complete your analysis, count the number of different genres. Also, the two tables can be merged by the movie ID. However, in pop_movies that column is called id, and in movies_to_genres it's called movie_id.

```python
# Use right join to merge the movie_to_genres and pop_movies tables
genres_movies = movie_to_genres.merge(pop_movies, how='right', 
                                      left_on="movie_id", 
                                      right_on = "id")
genres_movies.head()
# Count the number of genres
genre_count = genres_movies.groupby('genre').agg({'id':'count'})

# Plot a bar chart of the genre_count
genre_count.plot(kind='bar')

>**Example3- Using outer join to select actors**
>> One cool aspect of using an outer join is that, because it returns all rows from both merged tables and null where they do not match, you can use it to find rows that do not have a match in the other table. To try for yourself, you have been given two tables with a list of actors from two popular movies: Iron Man 1 and Iron Man 2. Most of the actors played in both movies. Use an outer join to find actors who did not act in both movies.

>> The Iron Man 1 table is called iron_1_actors, and Iron Man 2 table is called iron_2_actors. Both tables have been loaded for you and a few rows printed so you can see the structure.

>> Merging a table to itself can be useful when you want to compare values in a column to other values in the same column. In this exercise, you will practice this by creating a table that for each movie will list the movie director and a member of the crew on one row. You have been given a table called crews, which has columns id, job, and name. First, merge the table to itself using the movie ID. This merge will give you a larger table where for each movie, every job is matched against each other. Then select only those rows with a director in the left table, and avoid having a row where the director's job is listed in both the left and right tables. This filtering will remove job combinations that aren't with the director.

```python
# Merge the crews table to itself
crews_self_merged = crews.merge(crews, on='id', how='inner',
                                suffixes=('_dir','_crew'))

# Create a Boolean index to select the appropriate
boolean_filter = ((crews_self_merged['job_dir'] == "Director") & 
     (crews_self_merged['job_crew'] != "Director"))
direct_crews = crews_self_merged[boolean_filter]

# Print the first few rows of direct_crews
print(direct_crews.head())

>> Output 
        id   job_dir       name_dir        job_crew          name_crew

## Merging on indexes

> **Setting Index while importing**
```python
movies = pd.read_csv("tmdb_movies.csv", index_col=["id"])
```

> **Merging on an index**

```python
movies_taglines = movies.merge(taglines, on="id", how="left")
#In the output, id will be an index
```

> **Multi-index merge**
```python
samuel_casts = samuel.merge(casts, on=["movie_id","cast_id"])
```

> **Index merge with left_on and right_on - Inf index names are different in two tables**
```python
movies_genres = movies.merge(movie_to_genre, left_on="id", left_index=True, right_on="movie_id", right_index=True)
#To indicate that we are merging on indexes, we need to set these on true
```
> **Example 1 - Index merge for movie ratings**
>> To practice merging on indexes, you will merge movies and a table called ratings that holds info about movie ratings. Make sure your merge returns all of the rows from the movies table and not all the rows of ratings table need to be included in the result.

```python
# Merge to the movies table the ratings table on the index
movies_ratings = movies.merge(ratings, on="id", how="left")

# Print the first few rows of movies_ratings
print(movies_ratings.head())

>> Output
                      title  popularity release_date  vote_average  vote_count
id

> **Example - Do sequels earn more?**
>> It is time to put together many of the aspects that you have learned in this chapter. In this exercise, you'll find out which movie sequels earned the most compared to the original movie. To answer this question, you will merge a modified version of the sequels and financials tables where their index is the movie ID. You will need to choose a merge type that will return all of the rows from the sequels table and not all the rows of financials table need to be included in the result. From there, you will join the resulting table to itself so that you can compare the revenue values of the original movie to the sequel. Next, you will calculate the difference between the two revenues and sort the resulting dataset.

```python
# Merge sequels and financials on index id
sequels_fin = sequels.merge(financials, how="left", on="id")

print(sequels_fin.head())
              title sequel     budget    revenue
id

# Self merge with suffixes as inner join with left on sequel and right on id
orig_seq = sequels_fin.merge(sequels_fin, how="inner", left_on="sequel", 
                             right_on="id", right_index=True,
                             suffixes=("_org","_seq"))

# Add calculation to subtract revenue_org from revenue_seq 
orig_seq['diff'] = orig_seq['revenue_seq'] - orig_seq['revenue_org']

# Select the title_org, title_seq, and diff 
titles_diff = orig_seq[["title_org","title_seq","diff"]]

# Print the first rows of the sorted titles_diff
print(titles_diff.sort_values("diff", ascending=False).head())

>> Output

                   title_org        title_seq       diff

# Filtering joins

> **Mutating versus filtering joins**
- **Mutating Joins**
  - combines data from two tables based on matching observations in both tables
- **Filtering joins**
  - Filter observations from table based on whether or not they match an observation in another table

> **Semi-joins**
- Returns an interseation similar to inner join
- Returns columns from left tables only and **not** from the right table
- No duplicate rows are returned even if there is one to many relationships

> **Semi- join - Syntax**
>> **Step 1 -Inner join**

```python
genre_tracks = genres.merge(top_tracks, on="gid")
```

>> **Step2 - find the matches**

```python
genres["gid"].isin(genre_tracks["gid"])
```

>> **Step3 - Combine**

```python
top_genres = genres[genres["gid"].isin(genre_tracks["gid"])]
```
