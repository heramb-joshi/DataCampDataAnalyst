# Inner Join

## Inner join - will only returns rows having matching values on both tables
>**Merge syntax**
```python
ward_census = wards.merge(census, on='ward') #Two dataframes are merged on ward column
```

>**Suffixes syntax**
```python
ward_census = wards.merge(census, on='ward', suffixes=('_ward','_cen')) 
#Suffixes (overlapping columns) can be controlled instead of default _x and _y
```

>**Example - Your first inner join**
>> You have been tasked with figuring out what the most popular types of fuel used in Chicago taxis are. To complete the analysis, you need to merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables together on the vid column. You can then use the merged table along with the .value_counts() method to find the most common fuel_type.

```python
# Merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables
taxi_own_veh = taxi_owners.merge(taxi_veh, on="vid")

# Print the column names of the taxi_own_veh
print(taxi_own_veh.columns)

>> Output
Index(['rid', 'vid', 'owner_x', 'address', 'zip', 'make', 'model', 'year', 'fuel_type', 'owner_y'], dtype='object')

# Merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables setting a suffix
taxi_own_veh = taxi_owners.merge(taxi_veh, on='vid', suffixes = ('_own','_veh'))

# Print the column names of taxi_own_veh
print(taxi_own_veh.columns)

>> Output
Index(['rid', 'vid', 'owner_own', 'address', 'zip', 'make', 'model', 'year', 'fuel_type', 'owner_veh'], dtype='object')

# Print the value_counts to find the most popular fuel_type
print(taxi_own_veh['fuel_type'].value_counts()) # It counts the distinct values and their counts

>> Output

HYBRID                    2792
GASOLINE                   611
FLEX FUEL                   89
COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS      27
Name: fuel_type, dtype: int64
```

>**Example -Inner joins and number of rows returned**
>> All of the merges you have studied to this point are called inner joins. It is necessary to understand that inner joins only return the rows with matching values in both tables. You will explore this further by reviewing the merge between the wards and census tables, then comparing it to merges of copies of these tables that are slightly altered, named wards_altered, and census_altered. The first row of the wards column has been changed in the altered tables. You will examine how this affects the merge between them. The tables have been loaded for you.

```python
# Merge the wards and census tables on the ward column
wards_census = wards.merge(census, on="ward")

# Print the shape of wards_census
print('wards_census table shape:', wards_census.shape)

>> Output
wards_census table shape: (50, 9)

# Print the first few rows of the wards_altered table to view the change 
print(wards_altered[['ward']].head())

# Merge the wards_altered and census tables on the ward column
wards_altered_census = wards_altered.merge(census, on="ward")

# Print the shape of wards_altered_census
print('wards_altered_census table shape:', wards_altered_census.shape)

>> Output
  ward
0   61
1    2
2    3
3    4
4    5
wards_altered_census table shape: (49, 9)

# Print the first few rows of the census_altered table to view the change 
print(census_altered[['ward']].head())

# Merge the wards and census_altered tables on the ward column
wards_census_altered = wards.merge(census_altered, on="ward")

# Print the shape of wards_census_altered
print('wards_census_altered table shape:', wards_census_altered.shape)

>> Output
   ward
0  None
1     2
2     3
3     4
4     5
wards_census_altered table shape: (49, 9)
```

## One-to-many relationships

>**One-to-one** = Every row in the left table is related to one and only one row in the right table
>**One-to-many** = Every row in the left table is related to one or more one rows in the right table
>**Example - One-to-many merge**
>> A business may have one or multiple owners. In this exercise, you will continue to gain experience with one-to-many merges by merging a table of business owners, called biz_owners, to the licenses table. Recall from the video lesson, with a one-to-many relationship, a row in the left table may be repeated if it is related to multiple rows in the right table. In this lesson, you will explore this further by finding out what is the most common business owner title. (i.e., secretary, CEO, or vice president)

```python

```
