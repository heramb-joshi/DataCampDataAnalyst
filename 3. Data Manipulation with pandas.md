# Introducing DataFrames
## DataFrames
>**Pandas is based on NumPy and Matplotlib packages**
- In pandas, the rectangular data is stored as dataFrame object
- Every column in the dataFrame contain the same data type but different column can contain different data types

>**Ways of Exploring the data frame**
- .head() - display first five rows of the dataFrame
- .info() - displays names of columns, the data type and whether it has any missing columns
- .shape  - displays the dimension of the dataset into (rows, columns). Note that, this is an attribute and not a method hence the paranthesis is not required
- .describe() - computes some summary statstics for the columns. Provides quick overview of the numeric clumns
> Dataframes consists of three components, accessible through attributes
- .values - contains the data values reprenseted in 2D- NumPy array 1 array for each row 
- .columns - contains columns names
- .index - contains row numbers or row names

>**Exapmle - Pandas Dataset exploration**
```python
# Print the head of the homelessness data
print(homelessness.head())

# Print information about homelessness
print(homelessness.info())

# Print the shape of homelessness
print(homelessness.shape)

# Print a description of homelessness
print(homelessness.describe())
```
